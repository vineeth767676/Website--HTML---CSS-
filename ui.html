    <P>I have been involved in numerous AI/ ML projects. Each project had a different use case, some were consumer facing, others were internal facing; despite this, they all involved some form of UI. It is interesting because these projects are mostly a proof of technology where we would show that something is doable. However, most of our efforts are actually spent on building an interface for whatever AI solution we developed.

        I am not sure why it is surprising for me, maybe because I am a developer by nature. It is well-known that one of the most important skills in data science is story telling and communication. The same thing applies to AI; without being able to convey what value your solution brings to the customer or stakeholder efficiently, what youâ€™ve done goes to waste. This is a very important concept in AI, delivering something usable is as important as the model you build.
        That is why, it is important when you are building an AI related solution, you spend some effort on the UI and give the stakeholders a taste of how it will look eventually. It can be a simple bootstrap template, but as long as the UI is attractive and conveys the message clearly, it adds another good point to whatever you are delivering.
        I Like to think of AI as end-to-end a
